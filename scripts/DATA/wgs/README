wgs.txt is a list of strains that have been submitted for WGS
sequencing. They may not yet have been released to genbank and, if
sequencing is not successful, they may never be.

The list so far also contains only the strains since 2020-03, but this may be extended by copying over the strains in the USDA WGS reports.
