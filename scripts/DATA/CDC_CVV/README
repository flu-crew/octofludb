# CDC CVV

There may be many isolates for each CVV. Usually we only want one isolate for
each CVV in our pipelines. Therefore, I use epiflu ids (e.g., EPI_ISL_179403)
since strain names would be potentially be associated with many isolates.

files:
    isolate-ids.txt - a non-redundant list of epiflu isolate ids, one per CVV
