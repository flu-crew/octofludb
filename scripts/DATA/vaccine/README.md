# vaccines

The `isolate_ids.txt` file contains the epiflu isolate ids for 46 vaccine
strains.  These strains were selected by Catherine Smith (cab2@cdc.gov) in
collaboration with Nicola Lewis, Charles (Todd) Davis and Rebecca Kondor.

This list was received by flu-crew on July 7, 2021. If I update it in the
future changes should be reflected here (and in the git history).
