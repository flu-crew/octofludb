# Properties with the strain domain are not fields in the class object, using
# them to describe a subject leads to the inference that the subject is a
# strain. That is, these properties must only be used with subjects that are
# strains. For this reason, terms such as "country", "state", "date", and
# "host", which are all used to describe a strain, should not be listed has
# having strain as a domain, since they could be used in other contexts.

# This is the doubly defining link between a strain and a segment. Its use is
# sufficient to infer the class of both the subject and object. This rule,
# along with the other domain statements, means that it should never be
# necessary to explicitly state the type of an object.

# A segment is defined relative to a strain. The two unique properties it can
